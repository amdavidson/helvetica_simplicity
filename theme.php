	<p class="content">After being thouroughly disappointed by the themes available for the very neat <a href="http://sweetcron.com">SweetCron</a> software, I decided to code my own. </p>
	<p class="content">I'm no expert in design, nor am I even very well versed in it. I'm sure things will change here as I fumble my way through creating a cohesive design. As things do change though, I'll be updating this page with new versions.</p>
	<p class="content">I'm chosing to license it as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL3</a>, so feel free to use it, and change it around and do whatever you'd like, as long as you license your theme similarly.</p>
	<p class="content">If you do end up using this theme, please email me, it'd be great to hear that someone else got something out of it. <a href="mailto:theme@amdavidson.me">theme@amdavidson.me</a></p>
