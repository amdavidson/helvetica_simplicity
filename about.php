	<p class="title">About this page</p>
	<p class="content">As many people are, I'm coming to realize that my presence online is being scattered about the internet.</p>
	<p class="content">There are logical reasons for this, but the inverse is also reasonable, so here's one place to see all the information that I leave scattered about the web.</p>
	<p class="content">On the <a href="http://amdavidson.me">Lifestream</a> page you'll see content from all the following sites that I tend to update:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://amdavidson.com">AMDavidson.com</a>, my personal blog for all matters non-technical.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://andr3w.net">andr3w.net</a>, my geek blog.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://andromi.info">Andromi.info</a>, Naomi and I's wedding blog.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://delicious.com/amdavidson">Delicious</a>, my social bookmarks.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/amdavidson">Flickr</a>, where I post my photos.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://twitter.com/amdavidson">Twitter</a>, my twitter microblogging feed.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://vimeo.com/amdavidson">Vimeo</a>, a place where I have and will ocassionally post videos.</li>
		<li>&#187; <a href="http://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/superczar/favorites?v=2">YouTube</a>, videos that I've favorited.</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="content">Please forgive duplicated content on the Lifestream, there will often be times where I highlight a photo from Flickr on AMDavidson.com, or times where I Twitter about a link I've also bookmarked on Delicious. That's just part of the fragmentation of the social web, part of what this site hopes to fix, at least for me.</p>
